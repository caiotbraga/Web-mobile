    <h1>Endangered Species</h1>
    <p>A loss of habitat can happen naturally. 
        Dinosaurs, for instance, lost their habitat about <b>65 million years ago</b>.
        The hot, dry climate of the Cretaceous period changed very quickly, most likely because of an asteroid striking the Earth.
        The impact of the asteroid forced debris into the atmosphere, reducing the amount of heat and light that reached Earthâ€™s surface.
        The dinosaurs were unable to adapt to this new, <b>cooler habitat</b>. Dinosaurs became endangered, then extinct.
        Human activity can also contribute to a loss of habitat. Development for housing, industry, and agriculture reduces the habitat of native organisms. This can happen in a number of different ways.
